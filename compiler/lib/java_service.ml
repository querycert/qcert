(* This module contains process management to invoke a separate Java
   utility.  The utility has an expandable set of functions, such as
	 converting SQL source to an s-expression form of SQL that can be consumed by the next phase.
	 Also, parsing JRules, converting SQL schemas to JSON, and data loading using Apache commons-csv.
