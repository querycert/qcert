To Build:
---------

In the batch, it is only necessary that you be connected to the network the first time you 'make' this 
folder.  Dependencies will be acquired automatically.

Under Eclipse, to have the project build, simply run the getDependencies.xml Ant script.  Then, refresh
this project.

AsterixDB's Maven repository contributions do not include modular source attachments.  If you want to see the
source to the key dependencies, do the following steps.  The classpath of this project is already set up to
use the result.  You will also need these steps to run the AsterixDB unit tests.

1.  Clone the asterixDB repository from https://github.com/apache/asterixdb.git.  Use branch release-0.9.1 to
match the jars.

2.  In Eclipse preferences, go to General->Workspace->Linked Resources.  Check "Enable Linked Resources" if it
is not already checked.  Then, in the "Path Variables" section, select New and define the variable ASTERIXDB.
Specify as its value the location of the asterixdb subfolder of the working tree resulting from step 1.  As
the top folder of the cloned working tree is also called asterixdb, the result will be something like:

/Users/joshuaauerbach/git/asterixdb/asterixdb

3.  Refresh this project.

To run tests:
-------------

In batch: there is a target (make unit_tests) that will do this but only after you create and populate the
tests subdirectory.  To do that, you need to have cloned the asterixDB repository as described above.
Then, run the getTestsBatch ant script as in the following example:

ant -Dsource_dir=/Users/joshuaauerbach/git/asterixdb/asterixdb -f getTestsBatch.xml

Under Eclipse: first populate the tests folder by executing 'getTestsEclipse.xml' as an ant script.  Then
switch to batch and use the Makefile.  The getTestsEclipse.xml script only works under Eclipse and is a
minor convenience over getTestsBatch.xml since you don't have to specify the AsterixDB clone location if you have
already defined an ASTERIXDB variable for source attachment purposes.
